        <h3>Home Inspection</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A full home inspection gives buyers and homeowners a clear picture of the property's condition, structural integrity, safety issues, eletrical hazards, plumbing problems, roof condition, and more. It helps prevent unexpected repair costs and provides peace of mind before making a major investment.</p>
        <p><strong>How common issues are:</strong> Roughly 86% of homes inspected have at least one defect identified, and about 20% contain a major issue such as roofing problems, electrical hazards, or foundation concerns.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full structural assessment (foundation, framing, roof)</li>
            <li>Electrical system testing and safety verification</li>
            <li>Plumbing inspection for leaks, pressure, and pipe condition</li>
            <li>HVAC system operation and efficiency checks</li>
            <li>Attic, insulation, ventilation, and moisture review</li>
            <li>Appliance functionality testing</li>
            <li>Exterior inspection (grading, siding, windows, gutters)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong> Typically 3–4 hours, depending on home size and age.</p>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> A home inspection protects your investment, gives you negotiating power, and prevents costly surprises after moving in.</p>

        </div> 
        <h3>Pre-Listing Inspection</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A pre-listing inspection helps sellers identify issues before listing their home, giving them the chance to make repairs, avoid last-minute surprises, and position the property for a smoother sale. By knowing the true condition upfront, sellers can list confidently, avoid buyer negotiation pressure, and potentially increase their home’s final sale price.</p>
        <p><strong>How common issues are:</strong> Around 86% of homes have at least one defect discovered during inspection, and about 20% have a major issue such as roofing problems, electrical hazards, or foundation concerns. Finding these early allows sellers to decide what to fix—and prevent losing deals or being asked for costly concessions later.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full structural assessment (foundation, framing, roof)</li>
            <li>Electrical system testing and safety verification</li>
            <li>Plumbing inspection for leaks, pressure, and pipe condition</li>
            <li>HVAC system operation and efficiency checks</li>
            <li>Attic, insulation, ventilation, and moisture review</li>
            <li>Appliance functionality testing</li>
            <li>Exterior inspection (grading, siding, windows, gutters)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong> Typically 3–4 hours, depending on home size and age.</p>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> A pre-listing inspection gives sellers control during the sale. It reduces unexpected repair demands, shortens time on the market, boosts buyer confidence, and can help secure higher offers by showing the home is well-maintained and transparently evaluated.</p>

        </div> 
        <h3>Warranty Inspection (11-Month Inspection)</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Most new homes come with a 12-month builder warranty. A warranty inspection ensures any workmanship issues, hidden defects, or performance problems are found before your warranty expires—while the builder is still responsible for fixing them.</p>
        <p><strong>How common issues are:</strong> Over 90% of new homes develop issues within the first year, including settling cracks, insulation gaps, improper drainage, HVAC flaws, and incomplete workmanship.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Settlement and foundation crack review</li>
            <li>Roof, attic, and insulation inspection</li>
            <li>HVAC performance and ductwork issues</li>
            <li>Door, window, and trim alignment</li>
            <li>Moisture intrusion and caulking defects</li>
            <li>Electrical and plumbing system testing</li>
            <li>Appliance functionality</li>
            <li>Grading and drainage evaluation around the home</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong> Typically 90–120 minutes, depending on the home’s square footage.</p>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> A warranty inspection ensures you don’t pay for repairs the builder should cover. It protects your investment and ensures your new home performs the way it should.</p>

        <h3>New Build Inspection (Pre-Drywall & Final Walkthrough)</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Even brand-new homes can have serious construction defects. A new build inspection checks the home before it’s sealed up and again before closing—catching issues that affect safety, longevity, and performance. </p>
        <p><strong>How common issues are:</strong> Roughly 1 in 4 new homes have framing, electrical, plumbing, or insulation mistakes caught during pre-drywall inspections. Final walkthroughs often reveal dozens of smaller finish defects.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Pre-Drywall Inspection:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Framing accuracy and structural alignment</li>
            <li>Electrical rough-in, panel setup, and wire routing</li>
            <li>Plumbing lines, pressure tests, and drain alignment</li>
            <li>HVAC ducting, returns, and insulation placement</li>
            <li>Fire blocking, vapor barriers, and builder compliance</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Final Inspection:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full home inspection checklist (roof → foundation)</li>
            <li>Appliance testing</li>
            <li>HVAC performance checks</li>
            <li>Doors, windows, and trim alignment</li>
            <li>Exterior grading and water drainage</li>
            <li>Attic insulation and ventilation</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-Drywall:</strong> 60-90 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Final Inspection:</strong> 3-4 hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> A new build inspection ensures the home is built correctly before closing. It catches mistakes early—saving you thousands in structural, electrical, and insulation repairs down the road.</p>

        </div> 
        <h3>Mold Inspection</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Mold grows silently behind walls, in basements, under sinks, and in HVAC systems. It affects indoor air quality and can lead to respiratory issues, allergies, and long-term structural damage.</p>
        <p><strong>How common it is:</strong> About 70% of homes experience mold at some point, especially in humid or poorly ventilated areas.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visual inspection of moisture-prone areas</li>
            <li>Air sampling and surface testing</li>
            <li>Moisture meter readings</li>
            <li>Lab analysis for mold species and severity</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong> Typically 45–90 minutes, depending on home size.</p>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> Early mold detection prevents expensive repairs and protects your family’s health.</p>

        </div> 
        <h3>Radon Testing</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. You cannot see, smell, or taste it, so testing is the only way to know your home’s levels.</p>
        <p><strong>How common it is:</strong> Utah has some of the highest radon levels in the country, with roughly 1 in 3 homes testing above safe limits.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up a calibrated radon monitor</li>
            <li>48-hour testing period</li>
            <li>Report showing hourly radon levels and EPA recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong> Equipment setup takes minutes; testing runs 48 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> Radon mitigation is straightforward, but only if you know there’s a problem.</p>

        <h3>Meth Testing</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Residue from prior drug use or manufacturing can stay in walls, vents, and carpets for decades. Exposure can cause headaches, respiratory issues, and developmental concerns in children.</p>
        <p><strong>How common it is:</strong> In Utah, roughly 1 in 10 homes test positive for meth contamination—sometimes even without any visible signs.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Surface sampling in high-risk areas</li>
            <li>HVAC return testing</li>
            <li>Lab-certified results for accuracy</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong> Sampling takes up to 30 minutes; results usually return within 48–72 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> A meth-contaminated home can lose up to 25% of its value if not cleaned properly.</p>

        </div> 
        <h3>Fentanyl Testing</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Fentanyl residue can be hazardous even in tiny amounts. Homes used for recreational use, temporary rentals, or parties often have residues without knowing it.</p>
        <p><strong>How common it is:</strong> Law enforcement has reported fentanyl presence in an increasing number of Utah homes and vehicles yearly.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Swab testing of surfaces, bathrooms, kitchens, and HVAC</li>
            <li>On-site screening with lab confirmation</li>

        <h3>Sewer Scope Inspection</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Sewer line issues are one of the most expensive home repairs, often costing $5,000–$20,000 to fix.</p>
        <p><strong>How common it is:</strong> Over 40% of homes older than 25 years have root intrusion, cracks, or buildup in the sewer line.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insert a high-resolution camera into your sewer line</li>
            <li>Identify cracks, bellies, blockages, roots, and corrosion</li>
            <li>Provide video footage and recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How long it takes:</strong> About 30 minutes for most homes.</p>
        <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> A sewer scope can save thousands by catching problems early.</p>

        <h3>Water Quality Testing</h3>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Contaminants like bacteria, lead, nitrates, and chemicals can appear even in city water lines. Water quality impacts drinking, cooking, bathing, and overall health.</p>
        <p><strong>How common it is:</strong> Studies show 20–25% of homes have at least one water quality issue.</p>
        <p><strong>How we inspect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect samples from kitchen and bathroom fixtures</li>
            <li>Send for certified lab analysis</li>
            <li>Provide a full breakdown of contaminants</li>
        </ul>
